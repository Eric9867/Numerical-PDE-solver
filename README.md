A collection of algorithms for the numerical solution of PDEs. Based on the textbook Fundamentals of Computational Fluid Dynamics by Zingg, Lomax and Pulliam.

# Numerical PDE Solver
A small learning project I worked on during my time as an undergraduate researcher at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies Computational Aerodynamics Lab.
